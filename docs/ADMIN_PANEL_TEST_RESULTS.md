## 📝 Summary of v2.0 Changes

### Key Philosophy Change
**Before**: Teacher panel was a **class management tool** (create classes, add students)
**After**: Teacher panel is a **lab monitoring dashboard** (track student progress at exercise-level)

### UI Changes
1. **Main Dashboard**:
   - Replaced class cards with Student × Lab matrix table
   - Added lab status icons (✓ ⚠️ ❌ ○ 🔒)
   - Added at-risk student highlighting
   - Moved "Create Class" to settings menu

2. **New Pages**:
   - Student detail view with exercise-level tracking
   - Lab statistics view with class-wide metrics
   - Both clickable from main dashboard

3. **Data Depth**:
   - From: "Student completed X/6 labs"
   - To: "Student completed exercises 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 (2 attempts each), stuck on exercise 2.1 (5 failed attempts)"

### Technical Changes
1. **New Server Actions**: `getClassProgressDetailed()`, `getStudentProgress()`
2. **New Types**: `StudentProgressDetailed`, `LabProgress`, `ExerciseProgress`, `LabStatistics`
3. **New Routes**: `/students/[id]`, `/labs/[labNumber]`
4. **No Database Changes**: Uses existing `prompt_lab_progress` table

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Manual Testing**: Run through all 9 test scenarios (including 4 new v2.0 tests)
2. **Verify At-Risk Logic**: Ensure detection is accurate and helpful
3. **Collect Teacher Feedback**: Is exercise-level detail useful or too much?
4. **Iterate on UI**: Adjust based on real teacher usage
5. **Performance Check**: Test with larger classes (30+ students)

---

## 💡 Tips for Testing

1. **Use Incognito Windows**: For testing multiple users simultaneously
2. **Create Test Data**: Need students with various progress states:
   - Completed all labs
   - In progress on middle labs
   - Stuck on specific exercises (≥5 attempts)
   - Inactive for >7 days
3. **Check Browser Console**: For any JavaScript errors
4. **Check Network Tab**: For API errors
5. **Check Supabase Dashboard**: To verify data is being created correctly
6. **Test Navigation**: Ensure all click-through paths work (student → detail, lab → statistics)
