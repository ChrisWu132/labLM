# Supabase Security Assessment for Educational Use

**Date**: 2025-10-18
**Platform**: VibeCode Study
**Infrastructure**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage)

---

## Executive Summary

**Is Supabase secure enough for our educational platform? YES.**

For an early-stage educational platform targeting schools, Supabase provides enterprise-grade security infrastructure that would be expensive and time-consuming to build in-house. It meets or exceeds typical school security requirements.

**Key Verdict**:
- ✅ **Infrastructure Security**: Enterprise-grade (inherits AWS/Google Cloud compliance)
- ✅ **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit
- ✅ **Authentication**: Industry-standard auth with multiple providers
- ✅ **Access Control**: Row-Level Security (RLS) for data isolation
- ⚠️ **Compliance**: Not FERPA-certified (but can be FERPA-compliant with proper configuration)
- ⚠️ **Business Risk**: Third-party dependency (mitigated by open-source nature)

---

## Supabase Security Features

### 1. Infrastructure Security

**What Supabase Provides**:
- Hosted on **AWS** (US) or **Google Cloud** (international)
- Inherits cloud provider compliance: SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA-eligible
- DDoS protection via cloud infrastructure
- Regular security patches and updates

**What This Means for Schools**:
- ✅ You can say: "Hosted on enterprise-grade AWS infrastructure with SOC 2 compliance"
- ✅ Infrastructure security is handled by professionals
- ✅ No need to manage servers, firewalls, or network security

### 2. Data Encryption

**At Rest**:
- ✅ PostgreSQL databases encrypted using AES-256
- ✅ Storage buckets encrypted automatically
- ✅ Backup encryption enabled by default

**In Transit**:
- ✅ All connections use TLS 1.2+ (HTTPS/SSL)
- ✅ Database connections encrypted
- ✅ No unencrypted data transmission

**What This Means for Schools**:
- ✅ Student data is protected when stored
- ✅ Data cannot be intercepted during transmission
- ✅ Meets standard encryption requirements

### 3. Authentication & Access Control

**Supabase Auth Features**:
- ✅ Email/password authentication with secure password hashing
- ✅ OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, etc.) for SSO
- ✅ Magic link authentication (passwordless)
- ✅ JWT-based session management
- ✅ Multi-factor authentication (MFA) available
- ✅ Rate limiting on auth endpoints

**Row-Level Security (RLS)**:
- ✅ Database-level access control (not just app-level)
- ✅ Students can only access their own data
- ✅ Teachers can only see their classes (if implemented)
- ✅ Prevents direct database access from bypassing security

**Example RLS Policy**:
```sql
-- Students can only see their own progress
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own progress"
ON module_progress
FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Students can only update their own progress
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own progress"
ON module_progress
FOR UPDATE
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

**What This Means for Schools**:
- ✅ Strong user authentication
- ✅ Data isolation between students
- ✅ Protection against unauthorized access
- ✅ Database-level security (not just app logic)

### 4. Database Security

**PostgreSQL Security**:
- ✅ Connection pooling with SSL
- ✅ Prepared statements (SQL injection protection)
- ✅ Role-based access control
- ✅ Audit logging available

**Backup & Recovery**:
- ✅ Automatic daily backups (retained 7 days on free tier, 30+ days on paid)
- ✅ Point-in-time recovery on paid plans
- ✅ Backup encryption

**What This Means for Schools**:
- ✅ Data can be recovered if deleted accidentally
- ✅ Protection against data loss
- ✅ Standard disaster recovery capability

### 5. API Security

**Supabase API Features**:
- ✅ API keys with restricted permissions (anon vs service_role)
- ✅ Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- ✅ CORS configuration for domain restrictions
- ✅ RLS policies apply to all API calls

**Best Practices We Follow**:
- ✅ Use `anon` key for client-side (limited permissions)
- ✅ Never expose `service_role` key publicly
- ✅ RLS policies on all tables
- ✅ Input validation in application layer

---

## Security Gaps & Mitigations

### Gap 1: No FERPA Certification

**Issue**: Supabase itself is not "FERPA certified" (FERPA is a law, not a certification)

**Mitigation**:
1. **Data Processing Agreement (DPA)**: Sign DPA with schools outlining data handling
2. **Minimize Data Collection**: Only collect necessary student data
3. **Implement FERPA Principles**:
   - ✅ Student data privacy
   - ✅ Parent access rights (data export)
   - ✅ Data deletion upon request
   - ✅ No selling/sharing of student data
   - ✅ Security safeguards (encryption, RLS)

**What to Tell Schools**:
- "We follow FERPA-compliant data handling practices"
- "Hosted on FERPA-eligible infrastructure (AWS/Google Cloud)"
- "We sign Data Processing Agreements with all schools"

### Gap 2: Third-Party Dependency

**Issue**: Reliance on Supabase's uptime and security

**Mitigation**:
1. **Open Source**: Supabase is open-source, can self-host if needed
2. **Data Export**: Regular backups, can migrate to self-hosted or other providers
3. **Uptime SLA**: Supabase Pro tier offers 99.9% uptime SLA
4. **Monitoring**: Set up uptime monitoring and alerts

**Current Status**: Acceptable risk for early-stage startup

### Gap 3: Limited Audit Trail (Free Tier)

**Issue**: Free tier has limited audit logging

**Mitigation**:
1. **Application-Level Logging**: Implement our own audit trail for critical actions
2. **Upgrade Path**: Move to Pro tier when needed ($25/month for enhanced logging)
3. **Priority Actions**: Log authentication, data modifications, admin actions

**Implementation**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE audit_log (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  action TEXT,
  table_name TEXT,
  record_id UUID,
  timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ,
  ip_address TEXT
);
```

---

## Recommended Security Configurations

### 1. Row-Level Security (RLS)

**Required Policies** (must implement):

```sql
-- Enable RLS on all tables with student data
ALTER TABLE module_progress ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE prompt_lab_progress ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE user_profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Students access only their own data
CREATE POLICY "Own data only" ON module_progress
FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Admin access (for future admin panel)
CREATE POLICY "Admins can view all" ON module_progress
FOR SELECT USING (
  auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'admin'
);
```

### 2. Authentication Configuration

**Recommended Settings**:
- ✅ Email verification required
- ✅ Password strength: Minimum 8 characters
- ✅ Rate limiting: Max 5 login attempts per hour
- ✅ Session timeout: 7 days (school setting)
- ⚠️ Consider: Magic links for younger students (no password to remember)

### 3. API Security

**Environment Variables** (never commit):
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxx.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGc... # Safe for client
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGc...    # NEVER expose publicly
```

**API Key Permissions**:
- `anon` key: Read/write with RLS policies (use in client)
- `service_role` key: Bypass RLS (use only in server-side code)

### 4. Data Retention Policy

**Recommended Configuration**:
- Active accounts: Retain all data
- Inactive accounts (90+ days): Send reminder email
- Deleted accounts: Anonymize immediately, hard delete after 30 days
- Backups: Retain 30 days (upgrade to Pro tier)
