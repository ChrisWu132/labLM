## What is FERPA?

The **Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)** is a US federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. It applies to all schools that receive federal funding.

**Key Point**: FERPA is NOT a certification you obtain. It's a law you comply with through your practices and agreements.

## FERPA Compliance Checklist for VibeCode Study

### 1. Data Classification

**What Data Qualifies as "Education Records" Under FERPA?**

For our platform:
- ‚úÖ Student name + email
- ‚úÖ Lab progress/completion data
- ‚úÖ Exercise attempt history
- ‚úÖ Time spent on platform
- ‚úÖ LLM interaction logs (if we store them)
- ‚ùå De-identified/anonymized data (not covered by FERPA)

**Our Data Collection** (as of MVP):
```yaml
Student PII:
  - name: Required
  - email: Required
  - student_id: Optional (school-provided)
  - date_of_birth: NOT collected
  - address: NOT collected

Education Records:
  - lab_progress: Collected
  - exercise_attempts: Collected
  - timestamps: Collected
  - llm_conversations: NOT stored (privacy by design)
  - grades: NOT applicable (self-paced learning)
```

**Compliance Status**: ‚úÖ We minimize data collection

---

### 2. Parent Rights

**FERPA requires parents to have certain rights over student records.**

#### Right 1: Inspect and Review
**Requirement**: Parents can request to see their child's education records

**Our Implementation**:
- [ ] **TODO**: Build data export feature (parent can request from teacher)
- [ ] **TODO**: Teacher can export individual student report
- ‚úÖ Data is accessible to teachers (who share with parents)

**Process**:
1. Parent requests records from teacher
2. Teacher exports student report (PDF/CSV)
3. Teacher shares report with parent (within 45 days)

#### Right 2: Request Amendments
**Requirement**: Parents can request corrections to inaccurate records

**Our Implementation**:
- ‚úÖ Teachers can manually delete incorrect submissions
- ‚úÖ Students can retry exercises (self-correction)
- [ ] **TODO**: Document amendment request process

**Process**:
1. Parent/student identifies error
2. Contact teacher or support@vibecodestudy.com
3. We investigate and correct if warranted
4. Notify parent of outcome within 30 days

#### Right 3: Consent for Disclosure
**Requirement**: Schools must have parental consent to share education records with third parties (with exceptions)

**Our Implementation**:
- ‚úÖ We are a "school official" (service provider exception)
- ‚úÖ Schools sign Data Processing Agreement authorizing our access
- ‚úÖ We don't share data with other third parties
- ‚úÖ We don't sell student data

**Exceptions We Rely On**:
- School official exception (most common for edtech)
- No disclosure to other parties, so no consent needed

---

### 3. Data Processing Agreement (DPA)

**Requirement**: Schools need a written agreement with vendors handling student data

**Our DPA Must Include**:
- ‚úÖ Purpose of data access (provide educational services)
- ‚úÖ Types of data collected
- ‚úÖ How data will be used (only for service provision)
- ‚úÖ Security measures in place
- ‚úÖ No selling or sharing of student data
- ‚úÖ Data retention and deletion policy
- ‚úÖ Data breach notification procedures
- ‚úÖ Subprocessors (Supabase, OpenAI)

**Status**:

- [ ] **TODO**: Make DPA available for schools to sign

---

### 4. Security Safeguards

**Requirement**: Protect student data with appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards

#### Administrative Safeguards
- ‚úÖ Data access limited to authorized personnel only
- ‚úÖ Employee/contractor confidentiality agreements

- [ ] **TODO**: Enable MFA for admin accounts
- [ ] **TODO**: Audit logging for data access

#### Physical Safeguards
- ‚úÖ Cloud-hosted (AWS physical security)
- ‚úÖ No local storage of student data
- N/A: No physical servers to secure

**Compliance Status**: ‚úÖ Strong technical safeguards in place

### 5. Data Retention & Deletion

**Requirement**: Don't keep student data longer than necessary

**Our Policy**:
```yaml
Active Accounts:
  retention: Indefinite (while student is using platform)

Inactive Accounts:
  definition: No login for 90 days
  action: Send email reminder to student/teacher
  retention: Keep data for 1 year after last activity

Deleted Accounts:
  student_request: Immediate anonymization
  teacher_request: Immediate deletion of class enrollment
  hard_delete: After 30-day grace period
  backups: Removed from backups after 90 days

Graduated/Withdrawn Students:
  teacher_removes: Immediate class disenrollment
  data_retention: 1 year for records, then anonymize
  parent_request: Immediate deletion upon request
```

**Implementation**:

**Subprocessors** (vendors who process student data):
1. **Supabase**: Database and authentication
   - Purpose: Data storage
   - Data: All student data
   - DPA: Available from Supabase

2. **OpenAI** (or other LLM provider):
   - Purpose: LLM API for educational exercises
   - Data: Prompts submitted by students (transient)
   - DPA: Required (OpenAI offers DPA for API customers)
   - **Critical**: Ensure API calls opt-out of training data usage

3. **Resend** (or email service):
   - Purpose: Transactional emails (invitations, password resets)
   - Data: Email addresses, names
   - DPA: Check if available

**Action Items**:

## How to Demonstrate FERPA Compliance to Schools

### During Sales Conversations

**School asks**: "Are you FERPA compliant?"

**Answer**:
> "Yes, we follow FERPA-compliant data handling practices. We sign a Data Processing Agreement with all schools that outlines our data protection commitments, including encryption, access controls, and no selling of student data. Our platform is hosted on FERPA-eligible infrastructure (AWS/Supabase), and we only collect the minimum data necessary to provide our educational services."

**Follow up with**:
- Share our public security practices page
- Provide DPA for review
- Offer to complete their security questionnaire
- Reference Supabase's security documentation

### Common School Questions & Answers

**Q: What student data do you collect?**
> "We collect only what's necessary: student name, email, and learning progress (labs completed, time spent). We do NOT collect date of birth, address, or other sensitive personal information. LLM interactions are transient and not stored long-term."

**Q: Who has access to our student data?**
> "Only your teachers (for your students), our core engineering team (for platform maintenance), and our infrastructure providers (Supabase for hosting, OpenAI for LLM API). We maintain strict access controls and all team members sign confidentiality agreements."

**Q: How long do you keep student data?**
> "We keep data while the student is actively using the platform. For inactive accounts, we retain data for up to 1 year, then anonymize. Schools or parents can request immediate deletion at any time, and we'll provide an export of the data first."

**Q: What happens if there's a data breach?**
> "We have an incident response plan that includes immediate containment, assessment, and notification within 72 hours. We'll notify the school immediately and work with you to inform affected parents. Our security measures (encryption, access controls) are designed to prevent breaches in the first place."

**Q: Do you sell student data or use it for advertising?**
> "Absolutely not. We do not sell student data, ever. We do not use student data for advertising or any purpose other than providing educational services. This is explicitly stated in our Privacy Policy and Data Processing Agreement."
