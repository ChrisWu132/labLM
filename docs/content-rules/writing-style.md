# Writing Style Guide

**Status:** Active
**Effective Date:** 2025-01-20
**Applies To:** All lab content, UI text, and documentation

---

## Core Principles

1. **Clear and Direct** - Say what you mean in simple terms
2. **Age-Appropriate** - Written for grades 6-8 (ages 11-14)
3. **Encouraging** - Supportive without being condescending
4. **Precise** - Technically accurate without jargon
5. **Inclusive** - Accessible to all learning styles and backgrounds

---

## Tone

### What We Sound Like

- **Friendly mentor**, not a textbook
- **Patient teacher**, not a drill sergeant
- **Curious guide**, not a know-it-all
- **Supportive coach**, not a cheerleader

### What We Don't Sound Like

- ❌ Too formal/academic ("Herein we shall elucidate...")
- ❌ Too casual/slang ("Yo, this is lit!")
- ❌ Too patronizing ("Good job, little buddy!")
- ❌ Too technical ("Initialize the instantiation of...")

### Examples

✅ **Good:**
```
Let's learn how AI generates text. It's simpler than you might think.
```

❌ **Too formal:**
```
We shall now proceed to examine the mechanisms by which LLMs generate textual output.
```

❌ **Too casual:**
```
Yo, AI text generation is super easy, you got this fam!
```

## Language Guidelines

### Use Simple Words

Replace complex words with simple alternatives:

| Instead of... | Use... |
|---------------|--------|
| utilize | use |
| commence | start |
| terminate | end |
| facilitate | help |
| demonstrate | show |
| approximately | about |
| subsequently | then, next |
| implement | build, create |

### Keep Sentences Short

✅ **Good (12 words):**
```
AI learns from text. It looks for patterns. Then it predicts words.
```

❌ **Too long (28 words):**
```
Artificial intelligence systems learn from vast quantities of textual data by analyzing patterns, which subsequently enables them to generate predictions about which words should follow.
```

**Rule:** Aim for 15 words or fewer per sentence. Max 25 words.

### Use Active Voice

✅ **Active (clear subject):**
```
The AI generates text based on patterns.
You write prompts to guide the AI.
```

❌ **Passive (unclear subject):**
```
Text is generated by the AI based on patterns.
Prompts are written to guide the AI.
```

### Avoid Jargon

Define technical terms on first use:

✅ **Good:**
```
An LLM (Large Language Model) is an AI that understands and generates text.
```

❌ **Bad:**
```
An LLM leverages transformer architectures for NLU and NLG tasks.
```

---

## Structure

### Start With Why

Begin sections by explaining why the topic matters:

✅ **Good:**
```
Why learn about context windows?

Understanding context windows helps you write better prompts. When you know how much information AI can remember, you can structure your prompts more effectively.
```

❌ **Bad (jumps straight to what):**
```
Context windows are the amount of text an AI can process at once. They range from 4,000 to 128,000 tokens depending on the model.
```

### Use Headings Effectively

Structure content with clear hierarchy:

```markdown
## Main Topic (h2)
Brief introduction to the section.

### Subtopic (h3)
Detailed explanation of one aspect.

#### Sub-subtopic (h4)
Even more specific detail if needed.
```

### Break Up Dense Content

Use various content types:
- Short paragraphs (3-4 sentences max)
- Bullet lists for multiple points
- Numbered lists for steps
- Code examples for concepts
- Callout boxes for important notes

---

## Addressing the Student

### Use "You" (Not "We" or "One")

✅ **Good:**
```
You'll learn how to write effective prompts.
In this exercise, you'll create your first AI conversation.
```

❌ **Bad:**
```
We will learn how to write effective prompts.
One must learn to write effective prompts.
Students will learn how to write effective prompts.
```

### Be Direct

✅ **Good:**
```
Write a prompt that asks AI to explain photosynthesis.
```

❌ **Too indirect:**
```
You should consider writing a prompt that might ask the AI to provide an explanation regarding the process of photosynthesis.
```

---

## Explaining Concepts

### Use Analogies

Help students relate to new concepts:

✅ **Good:**
```
Think of AI's context window like your phone's camera viewfinder. It can only "see" what fits in the frame. Everything outside is invisible.
```

### Show, Then Tell

Provide examples before abstract explanations:

✅ **Good structure:**
```
1. Here's an example prompt: "Explain black holes like I'm 10 years old"
2. Look at what the AI generated: [output]
3. This works because... [explanation]
```

❌ **Bad structure:**
```
1. Theory about age-appropriate language adjustment
2. Abstract explanation of simplification techniques
3. Example (if you're still reading)
```

### Use Concrete Examples

Always ground concepts in real scenarios:

✅ **Good:**
```
Bad prompt: "Tell me about space"
Good prompt: "Explain how astronauts breathe on the International Space Station"

The second prompt is better because it's specific.
```

❌ **Abstract:**
```
Specificity improves prompt quality by reducing ambiguity and enabling more targeted responses.
```

## Common Patterns

### Introducing New Concepts

Template:
```markdown
## [Concept Name]

**Why it matters:** [One sentence explaining relevance]

**What it is:** [Simple definition in 1-2 sentences]

**Example:** [Concrete example]

**Try it:** [Hands-on exercise]
```

### Giving Instructions

Template:
```markdown
**Your task:** [What to do]

**Steps:**
1. [First action]
2. [Second action]
3. [Third action]

**What to expect:** [Describe the result]
```

### Providing Feedback

Use this structure:
```markdown
[Acknowledge attempt] + [Identify issue] + [Give specific guidance] + [Encourage]

Example:
"Good try! Your prompt is a bit too general. Try adding more details about what specific information you want. For example, instead of 'Tell me about cats,' try 'What are three unique behaviors that make cats different from dogs?' You're on the right track!"
```

---

## Formatting

### Emphasis

- **Bold** for important concepts or key terms
- *Italics* for emphasis or introducing new terms
- `Code formatting` for prompts, code, or technical terms

✅ **Good:**
```
The **context window** is how much text AI can "remember" at once. When you write a *very long* prompt, the AI might "forget" the beginning.
```

### Lists

Use bullet points for:
- Unordered items
- Features or characteristics
- Options to choose from

Use numbered lists for:
1. Sequential steps
2. Ordered procedures
3. Ranked items

### Code Blocks

Always label code blocks with the language:

```typescript
// TypeScript example
const greeting = "Hello, AI!"
```

```prompt
// Example prompt
Explain photosynthesis in simple terms for a 7th grader.
```

---

## Words to Avoid

### Avoid These Phrases

| Don't say... | Say instead... |
|--------------|----------------|
| "Obviously..." | [Just explain it] |
| "Simply..." | [It's not always simple] |
| "Just..." | [Don't minimize difficulty] |
| "Clearly..." | [It may not be clear] |
| "Everyone knows..." | [They might not] |
| "It's easy..." | [Relative to the learner] |

### Avoid Gendered Pronouns

Use "they/them" or "the student" instead of "he" or "she":

✅ **Good:**
```
When a student completes the exercise, they should...
```

❌ **Avoid:**
```
When a student completes the exercise, he should...
```

## Tools

### Readability Testing

Use these tools to check reading level:
- Hemingway App (aim for Grade 6-7)
- Readable.com (aim for Flesch-Kincaid Grade 6-8)

### Inclusive Language

## Examples

### Bad Example

```
Henceforth, we shall delve into the intricacies of prompt engineering methodologies. One must comprehend that the efficacy of LLM-generated outputs is contingent upon the specificity and clarity of one's input prompts. To illustrate this concept, consider the following scenario wherein we compare two distinct prompt formulations...
```

**Issues:**
- Overly formal language
- Long, complex sentences
- Uses "one" instead of "you"
- Doesn't explain "efficacy" or "contingent"
- Takes too long to get to the point

### Good Example

```
Let's learn how to write great prompts.

Good prompts get good results. When you write clear, specific prompts, the AI gives you better answers.

Here's a comparison:

Vague prompt: "Tell me about animals"
AI response: Generic info about many animals

Specific prompt: "What are three ways dolphins communicate underwater?"
AI response: Focused, detailed answer about dolphin communication

See the difference? The specific prompt gets a more useful response.

Now try it yourself!
```

**Why it works:**
- Simple, direct language
- Short sentences
- Uses "you" voice
- Provides clear examples
- Explains the benefit
- Invites action
