# Lab Restructuring Plan: Micro-Sections with Learn/Practice Separation

**Status**: Draft
**Created**: 2025-01-20
**Author**: Product Team
**Target**: Labs 1-6 Content Restructuring

---

## Executive Summary

Restructure all 6 labs from long-form continuous content into **micro-sections** (5-7 minutes each) with **learn/practice tab separation** within each section. This addresses middle school students' attention span limitations and provides clearer mental models for learning vs. doing.

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Reduced cognitive load per session
- Higher completion rates
- Clearer progress tracking
- Better retention through spaced practice

---

## Problem Statement

### Current Issues

1. **Content Length Fatigue**
   - Lab 5: 34KB of content (~15-20 min continuous reading + exercises)
   - Middle schooler attention span: 10-15 minutes max
   - No natural break points for pausing

2. **Mixed Content Types**
   - Theory, exercises, and quizzes interleaved
   - Unclear mental model: "Am I learning or practicing?"
   - Hard to review concepts while doing exercises

3. **Lab 6 Learning Cliff**
   - Labs 1-5: Simple text prompts
   - Lab 6: Complex visual workflow builder
   - No scaffolding or gradual introduction

4. **Progress Ambiguity**
   - Students don't know how much is left
   - Can't see what they've accomplished
   - Hard to resume after interruption

---

## Proposed Solution: Hybrid Micro-Section Structure

### Overview

Break each lab into **5-7 minute sections** (vertical slicing), with **Learn/Practice tabs** within each section (horizontal separation).

```
Lab 1: Meet Your AI Friend

  Section 1.1: What is AI? (5 min)
    [üìñ Learn] [üéØ Try It]

  Section 1.2: Your First Prompt (5 min)
    [üìñ Learn] [üéØ Try It]

  Section 1.3: Why Different Answers? (5 min)
    [üìñ Learn] [üéØ Try It]

  Section 1.4: Experiment Time (7 min)
    [üìñ Learn] [üéØ Try It]

  Section 1.5: Review & Quiz (5 min)
    [üìñ Recap] [‚úÖ Quiz]
```

### Design Principles

1. **Bite-sized chunks**: Each section = one concept + one practice
2. **Clear separation**: Learn tab (theory) vs Try It tab (practice)
3. **Sequential unlock**: Complete section N to unlock N+1
4. **Flexible pacing**: Can pause between sections
5. **Always accessible**: Can revisit completed sections anytime

## Detailed Design

### Section Structure

Each section contains:

```yaml
section:
  id: "1.1"
  title: "What is AI?"
  estimatedTime: 5  # minutes
  status: "locked" | "in_progress" | "completed"
  tabs:
    - learn:
        type: "content"
        content: "Theory, explanations, examples"
        media: ["text", "images", "videos"]
    - tryIt:
        type: "interactive"
        exercises:
          - id: "1.1-ex1"
            prompt: "Exercise prompt"
            successCriteria: {...}
```

### Tab Types

**Learn Tab (üìñ)**:
- Pure content consumption
- Read explanations
- Watch examples
- See demonstrations
- No exercises (except quick checks)
- Estimated time: 2-3 min

**Try It Tab (üéØ)**:
- Pure practice - **MUST BE INTERACTIVE**
- **REQUIRED COMPONENTS**:
  - ‚úÖ PromptEditor component (editable text area)
  - ‚úÖ "Run Prompt" button that calls runPrompt() server action
  - ‚úÖ LLMOutputDisplay component showing actual AI responses
  - ‚úÖ Real-time feedback based on student's actual submissions
  - ‚úÖ Success validation based on completed attempts
- **NOT ACCEPTABLE**:
  - ‚ùå Static text with fake "submit" counters
  - ‚ùå Instructions without actual prompt editor
  - ‚ùå Describing what students "should" do without letting them do it
- Can reference Learn tab anytime
- Estimated time: 2-4 min of actual hands-on practice

**Quiz Tab (‚úÖ)** (final section only):
- Review questions
- Self-assessment
- Summary of discoveries

## Impact Assessment

### Code Changes

| Area | Impact | Effort |
|------|--------|--------|
| Database schema | Medium | Low (2 new tables) |
| Content files | High | High (restructure all labs) |
| Components | Medium | Medium (5-7 new components) |
| Routes | Medium | Medium (new nested routes) |
| State management | Low | Low (extend existing) |
| Testing | Medium | Medium (update test suites) |

**Total Estimated Effort**: 6-9 weeks (1 developer)

### User Experience Changes

**Positive**:
- ‚úÖ Clearer progress tracking
- ‚úÖ Better attention span alignment
- ‚úÖ Easier to pause and resume
- ‚úÖ Less overwhelming per session
- ‚úÖ Clearer learning vs practicing distinction

**Potential Concerns**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è More clicks to complete a lab
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Could feel more fragmented
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to educate users on new structure

**Mitigation**:
- Show total estimated time upfront
- Allow "Mark section complete" without visiting Try It tab (for advanced users)
- Add "Quick Complete" mode for users who want to skip ahead

### Analytics to Track

**Engagement**:
- Section completion rate
- Average time per section
- Drop-off points (which sections lose students)
- Tab usage patterns (Learn vs Try It)

**Performance**:
- Overall lab completion rate (before vs after)
- Time to complete full lab
- Return rate (students coming back next day)

**Quality**:
- Quiz scores by section
- Exercise success rate
- Teacher feedback

---

## Success Metrics

### Primary Metrics

| Metric | Current Baseline | Target | Measurement |
|--------|-----------------|--------|-------------|
| Lab completion rate | TBD | +25% | % of students who complete all 6 labs |
| Average session length | TBD | 8-12 min | Time spent per session |
| Return rate | TBD | +40% | % students who return next day |
| Exercise success rate | TBD | >70% | % exercises passed on first try |

### Secondary Metrics

- Section completion time (should be ‚â§ estimated time)
- Tab switch frequency (Learn ‚Üî Try It)
- Section revisit rate
- Teacher satisfaction score

---

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Content Fragmentation

**Risk**: Breaking content into small chunks loses narrative flow

**Mitigation**:
- Each section's Learn tab includes "Previously..." recap
- Final section includes comprehensive review
- Visual progress indicator shows big picture

### Risk 2: Increased Development Time

**Risk**: Restructuring all labs takes longer than planned

**Mitigation**:
- Pilot with Lab 1 first (validate approach)
- Use templates for repetitive sections
- Parallelize content creation and development

### Risk 3: User Confusion

**Risk**: Students don't understand new structure

**Mitigation**:
- Add onboarding tooltip tour
- Show video tutorial in orientation
- Provide teacher guide for explaining structure

### Risk 4: Mobile Experience

**Risk**: Tabs don't work well on small screens

**Mitigation**:
- Test on mobile early
- Consider accordion layout for mobile
- Ensure touch targets are adequate

---

## Open Questions

1. **Section unlock strategy**:
   - Must complete both Learn + Try It tabs to unlock next section?
   - Or just visiting Learn tab is enough?
   - Or allow skip for advanced users?

2. **Content distribution**:
   - Should all sections be equal length (5 min)?
   - Or allow variability (3-10 min)?

3. **Lab 6 tutorial**:
   - Force all users through tutorial?
   - Or allow "Skip Tutorial" option?

4. **Progress granularity**:
   - Track tab-level progress (Learn visited, Try It completed)?
   - Or just section-level (completed/not completed)?

5. **Teacher visibility**:
   - Show teachers section-level progress?
   - Or just lab-level is sufficient?

---

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate** (this week):
   - [ ] Review and approve this plan
   - [ ] Gather feedback from teachers/students (if possible)
   - [ ] Finalize section breakdown for Lab 1

2. **Week 1**:
   - [ ] Start Phase 1 (infrastructure)
   - [ ] Begin content creation for Lab 1

3. **Week 2**:
   - [ ] Complete Phase 1
   - [ ] Internal testing of new components

4. **Week 3**:
   - [ ] Start Phase 2 (Lab 1 pilot)
   - [ ] User testing with small group

## Appendices

### A. Example Section Content

**Lab 1, Section 1.1: "What is AI?"**

**Learn Tab** (üìñ):
```markdown
# What is AI?

You've probably heard the term "AI" everywhere - in movies,
games, and the news. But what actually is it?

## AI vs Search Engines

When you search on Google, it finds web pages that match
your keywords. It's like a super-fast librarian.

When you talk to an AI like ChatGPT, it generates new text
based on patterns it learned. It's more like a conversation partner.

[Comparison diagram here]

## What is an LLM?

LLM stands for "Large Language Model" - the type of AI you'll
be working with in these labs...

[2-minute video explaining LLMs]

## Key Points
- AI creates new content, search finds existing content
- LLMs are trained on huge amounts of text
- Every response is generated fresh, not retrieved

Ready to try talking to an AI?

**Try It Tab** (üéØ):
```tsx
# Try It: Spot the Difference

Let's see if you can tell the difference between AI and search.

## Exercise 1.1

Look at these two responses to "Tell me about space":

Response A:
[Shows Google search results screenshot]

Response B:
[Shows LLM generated paragraph about space]

Which one came from an AI? Which came from a search engine?

[Radio buttons for student to choose]

[Check Answer button]

‚úÖ Success Criteria:
- Identify which is AI-generated
- Explain one difference between them

## CRITICAL LESSONS LEARNED (2025-01-20)

### Issue #1: What is NOT an Exercise

**Problem Discovered**: During code review of Lab 1, sections 1.2-1.4 were marked "complete" but had NO actual interactive exercises.

**What Was Wrong**:
```tsx
// WRONG - This is NOT an exercise!
export default function TryIt() {
  const [attemptCount, setAttemptCount] = useState(0)

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Try this prompt: "Write about healthy eating"</p>
      <p>Use the prompt editor below!</p>  {/* ‚Üê NO EDITOR EXISTS! */}
      <button onClick={() => setAttemptCount(prev => prev + 1)}>
        Submit  {/* ‚Üê FAKE BUTTON, DOESN'T DO ANYTHING */}
      </button>
      <p>Attempts: {attemptCount}</p>  {/* ‚Üê FAKE COUNTER */}
    </div>
  )
}
```

**What's Required**:
```tsx
// CORRECT - Real interactive exercise
export default function TryIt() {
  const [output, setOutput] = useState('')
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false)

  const handleSubmit = async (prompt: string) => {
    setLoading(true)
    const result = await runPrompt({ prompt, labNumber: 1, exerciseId: '1.2' })
    setOutput(result.output)
    setLoading(false)
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <PromptEditor
        onSubmit={handleSubmit}
        initialValue="Write about healthy eating"
      />
      <LLMOutputDisplay
        content={output}
        loading={loading}
      />
    </div>
  )
}
```

**Key Differences**:
- ‚úÖ Real PromptEditor component that students can type in
- ‚úÖ Real runPrompt() server action that calls OpenAI API
- ‚úÖ Real LLMOutputDisplay showing actual AI responses
- ‚úÖ Students actually PRACTICE, not just READ instructions

### Issue #2: Performance - Database Migration Not Deployed

**Problem**: Page loads take 13+ seconds on first visit, 1.4s on navigation

**Root Cause**:
- `getLabProgress()` queries `section_progress` table
- Migration file exists but wasn't deployed to Supabase
- Query fails/times out on non-existent table

**Solution**:
1. Deploy migration: `supabase/migrations/20251020000000_section_progress.sql`
2. Verify table creation
3. Re-test load times (should be < 2s)

### Action Items

**Before Declaring Phase 2 Complete**:
- [ ] Add PromptEditor + runPrompt + LLMOutputDisplay to section 1.2
- [ ] Add PromptEditor + runPrompt + LLMOutputDisplay to section 1.3
- [ ] Add PromptEditor + runPrompt + LLMOutputDisplay to section 1.4
- [ ] Deploy database migration to production
- [ ] Verify load times < 2 seconds
- [ ] Test all exercises actually work with real AI responses

**Updated Definition of "Exercise Complete"**:
- ‚úÖ PromptEditor component rendered
- ‚úÖ runPrompt() server action integrated
- ‚úÖ LLMOutputDisplay component showing responses
- ‚úÖ Student can type prompt and get real AI response
- ‚úÖ Feedback is based on actual student actions
- ‚ùå NO fake counters or static text pretending to be interactive
