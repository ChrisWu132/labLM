### **Phase 2 Assessment Summary**

**What Works**: ‚úÖ
- [x] Infrastructure complete
- [x] Section navigation functional
- [x] Progress tracking implemented
- [x] Learn tabs all have quality content
- [x] Section 1.1 & 1.5 have real interactive components

**What's Broken**: ‚ùå
- [‚ùå] **Sections 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 have no actual exercises**
  - Students see instructions to "use prompt editor below"
  - NO prompt editor exists in these sections
  - NO LLM integration
  - Cannot actually practice prompts
  - This defeats the purpose of "Try It" tabs!

**Performance Issues**: ‚ö†Ô∏è
1. **Slow initial load**: 13.6 seconds for lab overview page
   - 7.1s compilation (Next.js cold start)
   - 6.5s server rendering (includes DB query to non-existent table)
   - **Root cause**: `getLabProgress()` queries `section_progress` table that hasn't been migrated yet

2. **Slow navigation**: 1.4 seconds per section navigation
   - POST actions to mark sections complete take 1.4s
   - **Root cause**: Database migration not deployed

**Success Criteria for Phase 2**: ‚ùå NOT MET
- [‚ùå] Lab 1 works end-to-end ‚Üí NO, exercises missing
- [x] Progress tracking functional ‚Üí YES (but slow)
- [x] No regressions ‚Üí YES
- [x] Build succeeds ‚Üí YES

**Deliverables**: ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY DELIVERED
- ‚úÖ Complete Lab 1 structure (5 sections, 10 files)
- ‚úÖ All Learn tabs have full educational content
- ‚ùå Only 2/5 sections have real interactive exercises
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Performance issues due to missing DB migration

## Next Steps & Decisions Needed

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **User Testing** (Priority 1)
   - [x] Build successful - ready for local testing
   - [ ] Test full Lab 1 completion flow (all 5 sections)
   - [ ] Verify progress tracking works correctly
   - [ ] Test on mobile devices
   - [ ] Deploy database migration to enable section progress

2. **Content Migration** (Priority 2 - Choose path)
   - [ ] **Option A**: Migrate Lab 2 content to micro-sections
   - [ ] **Option B**: Start Lab 6 tutorial design
   - **Recommendation**: Start with Lab 2 migration to maintain momentum

### Decisions Needed

‚ùì **Open Questions** (from original PRD):

1. **Section unlock strategy**:
   - ‚úÖ DECIDED: Must complete section to unlock next
   - Currently: Completing a section unlocks the next one
   - Consider: Allow skipping for advanced users?

2. **Content distribution**:
   - ‚úÖ DECIDED: Variable length (3-10 min) based on content needs
   - Lab 1: 5min, 5min, 5min, 7min, 5min

3. **Progress granularity**:
   - ‚úÖ DECIDED: Track tab visits + section completion
   - `learn_tab_visited` and `try_it_tab_visited` tracked

4. **Teacher visibility**:
   - ‚è∏Ô∏è PENDING: Show section-level progress in teacher dashboard?
   - Decision needed before Phase 5

5. **Lab 6 tutorial**:
   - ‚è∏Ô∏è PENDING: Force tutorial or allow skip?
   - Decision needed before Phase 3
