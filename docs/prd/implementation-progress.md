## Next Steps & Decisions Needed

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **User Testing** (Priority 1)
   - [x] Build successful - ready for local testing
   - [ ] Test full Lab 1 completion flow (all 5 sections)
   - [ ] Verify progress tracking works correctly
   - [ ] Test on mobile devices
   - [ ] Deploy database migration to enable section progress

2. **Content Migration** (Priority 2 - Choose path)
   - [ ] **Option A**: Migrate Lab 2 content to micro-sections
   - [ ] **Option B**: Start Lab 6 tutorial design
   - **Recommendation**: Start with Lab 2 migration to maintain momentum

### Decisions Needed

‚ùì **Open Questions** (from original PRD):

1. **Section unlock strategy**:
   - ‚úÖ DECIDED: Must complete section to unlock next
   - Currently: Completing a section unlocks the next one
   - Consider: Allow skipping for advanced users?

2. **Content distribution**:
   - ‚úÖ DECIDED: Variable length (3-10 min) based on content needs
   - Lab 1: 5min, 5min, 5min, 7min, 5min

3. **Progress granularity**:
   - ‚úÖ DECIDED: Track tab visits + section completion
   - `learn_tab_visited` and `try_it_tab_visited` tracked

4. **Teacher visibility**:
   - ‚è∏Ô∏è PENDING: Show section-level progress in teacher dashboard?
   - Decision needed before Phase 5

5. **Lab 6 tutorial**:
   - ‚è∏Ô∏è PENDING: Force tutorial or allow skip?
   - Decision needed before Phase 3
