- Understand what LLMs are and how they work
- Learn the difference between AI, LLMs, and search engines
- Write your first prompts and see how they affect AI responses
- Discover why clear communication matters when talking to AI

## Part A: Understanding LLMs (10 minutes)

### What is AI? What is an LLM?

**AI (Artificial Intelligence)** is software that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence - like understanding language, recognizing patterns, and making decisions.

**LLM (Large Language Model)** is a specific type of AI that specializes in understanding and generating text. Think of it as an extremely well-read assistant that has learned from millions of books, articles, and conversations.

**Examples of LLMs**: ChatGPT, Claude, Google Gemini

### LLM vs Search Engine vs Calculator

Let's understand the difference:

<TableCard title="Tool Comparison">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Tool</th>
<th>What it does</th>
<th>Example</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Calculator</strong></td>
<td>Follows exact rules, always same answer</td>
<td>2 + 2 = 4 (always)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Search Engine</strong></td>
<td>Finds existing web pages</td>
<td>Shows links to cat information</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>LLM</strong></td>
<td>Generates new text based on patterns</td>
<td>Creates a unique explanation about cats</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</TableCard>

**Key insight**: An LLM doesn't search the internet or calculate. It **predicts** what words should come next based on patterns it learned during training.

### How Does an LLM Work?

Think of an LLM like this:

**The "Next Word Predictor"**

When you write: "The sky is..."
- A human would say: "blue"
- An LLM predicts: "blue" (most likely), "clear" (also likely), "falling" (less likely)

**It works by**:
1. Reading your prompt
2. Breaking it into pieces (tokens)
3. Predicting what should come next, word by word
4. Continuing until it has a complete response

**Important**: The AI isn't thinking or conscious. It's using statistical patterns to generate helpful text.

<ExperimentBlock title="Interactive Experiment 1: See the AI in Action">

Let's observe how an LLM responds to a simple question.

<StaticPromptDemo
  initialValue="What is a cat?"
  demoOutput="A cat is a small carnivorous mammal that has been domesticated for thousands of years. Cats are known for their independence, agility, and hunting skills. They are popular pets worldwide and come in many breeds with different appearances and personalities. Cats communicate through meowing, purring, and body language."
/>

**Try this multiple times** - Click "Run Prompt" below and run it again. Notice something interesting?

<PromptEditor
  exerciseId="lab1-demo"
  mode="editable"
  placeholder="What is a cat?"
/>

**What did you notice?** The answer is slightly different each time! This is because LLMs have some randomness built in - they don't always pick the *most* likely next word, but sometimes choose from the top few options.

### Key Concept: AI is a Tool, Not a Person

**Remember**:
- LLMs are incredibly useful tools
- They can help you learn, write, and solve problems
- They are NOT conscious or thinking
- They don't have feelings or opinions (they just predict text patterns)

Think of an LLM like a really smart parrot that has read millions of books - it can produce impressive language, but it's not truly understanding like a human does.

---

## Part B: Your First Conversation (10 minutes)

### What is a Prompt?

A **prompt** is the instruction or question you give to an LLM. It's how you communicate what you want.

**Prompt** = Input (what you say)
**Response** = Output (what AI generates)

The better your prompt, the better the response!

---

<ExerciseBlock title="Improving Your Questions" number={1}>

Let's see how clarity affects AI responses.

<PromptComparison
  badPrompt="Tell me about dogs."
  badOutput="Dogs are domesticated mammals that belong to the Canidae family. They come in various breeds, sizes, and temperaments."
  goodPrompt="Explain to a 10-year-old why dogs are good pets. Include 3 specific reasons."
  goodOutput="Dogs make great pets for three main reasons: 1) Loyal Companions - they're like best friends who never get tired of playing! 2) Teach Responsibility - caring for them builds life skills. 3) Keep You Active - walks and playtime mean more outdoor fun!"
/>

**Now you try!** Improve this vague prompt:

<PromptEditor
  exerciseId="lab1-ex1"
  mode="editable"
  placeholder="Write a better version of: 'Tell me about cats'

Hint: Be specific about:
- Who should the explanation be for?
- What aspects of cats interest you?
- How long should the answer be?"
/>

**Success Criteria**:
- Your prompt asks for specific information about cats
- It includes context (who it's for, what aspects, etc.)
- The AI response is focused and detailed

<ExerciseBlock title="Let AI Write a Story" number={2}>

Now let's have fun! Ask the AI to write a creative story.

<PromptEditor
  exerciseId="lab1-ex2"
  mode="editable"
  placeholder="Write a short adventure story about a brave cat. Include:
- Where the adventure takes place
- What challenge the cat faces
- How the cat solves the problem
Keep it under 150 words."
/>

**What to notice**:
- The more details you provide, the better the story
- Each time you run it, you'll get a slightly different story
- The AI follows your instructions (length, elements to include)

</ExerciseBlock>

<DiscoveriesCard>

1. **LLMs are prediction machines** - They generate text by predicting what words should come next, based on patterns from their training data.

2. **Clarity matters** - The more specific and clear your prompt, the better the AI's response will be.

3. **Variability is normal** - LLMs have some randomness, so running the same prompt twice gives slightly different results.

4. **AI is a tool** - LLMs are powerful assistants, but they're not thinking beings. They're tools that help us work faster and learn better.

<NextSteps href="/dashboard/vibecoding/labs/lab2">

Great job! You've taken your first steps into the world of AI.

**In Lab 2**, you'll learn:
- How LLMs actually learn (where does all that knowledge come from?)
- Advanced techniques for writing clear, effective prompts
- Why being specific makes AI much more useful

**Remember**: The best way to learn is by experimenting! Try changing your prompts and seeing how the AI responds differently. There's no wrong way to explore.
