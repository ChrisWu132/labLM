# Lab 1: Meet Your AI Friend

## üìñ Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will:
- Understand what LLMs are and how they work
- Learn the difference between AI, LLMs, and search engines
- Write your first prompts and see how they affect AI responses
- Discover why clear communication matters when talking to AI

**Duration**: ~20 minutes

---

## Part A: Understanding LLMs (10 minutes)

### What is AI? What is an LLM?

**AI (Artificial Intelligence)** is software that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence - like understanding language, recognizing patterns, and making decisions.

**LLM (Large Language Model)** is a specific type of AI that specializes in understanding and generating text. Think of it as an extremely well-read assistant that has learned from millions of books, articles, and conversations.

**Examples of LLMs**: ChatGPT, Claude, Google Gemini

---

### LLM vs Search Engine vs Calculator

Let's understand the difference:

| Tool | What it does | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Calculator** | Follows exact rules, always same answer | 2 + 2 = 4 (always) |
| **Search Engine** | Finds existing web pages | Shows links to cat information |
| **LLM** | Generates new text based on patterns | Creates a unique explanation about cats |

**Key insight**: An LLM doesn't search the internet or calculate. It **predicts** what words should come next based on patterns it learned during training.

---

### How Does an LLM Work?

Think of an LLM like this:

**The "Next Word Predictor"**

When you write: "The sky is..."
- A human would say: "blue"
- An LLM predicts: "blue" (most likely), "clear" (also likely), "falling" (less likely)

**It works by**:
1. Reading your prompt
2. Breaking it into pieces (tokens)
3. Predicting what should come next, word by word
4. Continuing until it has a complete response

**Important**: The AI isn't thinking or conscious. It's using statistical patterns to generate helpful text.

### üî¨ Interactive Experiment 1: See the AI in Action

Let's observe how an LLM responds to a simple question.

<StaticPromptDemo
  prompt="What is a cat?"
  output="A cat is a small carnivorous mammal that has been domesticated for thousands of years. Cats are known for their independence, agility, and hunting skills. They are popular pets worldwide and come in many breeds with different appearances and personalities. Cats communicate through meowing, purring, and body language."
/>

**Try this multiple times** - Click "Run Prompt" below and run it again. Notice something interesting?

<PromptEditor
  exerciseId="lab1-demo"
  labNumber={1}
  placeholder="What is a cat?"
/>

**What did you notice?** The answer is slightly different each time! This is because LLMs have some randomness built in - they don't always pick the *most* likely next word, but sometimes choose from the top few options.

### üéØ Key Concept: AI is a Tool, Not a Person

**Remember**:
- ‚úÖ LLMs are incredibly useful tools
- ‚úÖ They can help you learn, write, and solve problems
- ‚ùå They are NOT conscious or thinking
- ‚ùå They don't have feelings or opinions (they just predict text patterns)

Think of an LLM like a really smart parrot that has read millions of books - it can produce impressive language, but it's not truly understanding like a human does.

---

## Part B: Your First Conversation (10 minutes)

### What is a Prompt?

A **prompt** is the instruction or question you give to an LLM. It's how you communicate what you want.

**Prompt** = Input (what you say)
**Response** = Output (what AI generates)

The better your prompt, the better the response!

---

### ‚úèÔ∏è Exercise 1: Improving Your Questions

Let's see how clarity affects AI responses.

**Bad Prompt** (vague):
<StaticPromptDemo
  prompt="Tell me about dogs."
  output="Dogs are domesticated mammals that belong to the Canidae family. They come in various breeds, sizes, and temperaments. Dogs are known as loyal companions and have been living with humans for thousands of years."
/>

**Good Prompt** (specific):
<StaticPromptDemo
  prompt="Explain to a 10-year-old why dogs are good pets. Include 3 specific reasons."
  output="Dogs make great pets for three main reasons:

1. **Loyal Companions**: Dogs love their families and will always be happy to see you when you come home. They're like having a best friend who never gets tired of playing with you!

2. **Teach Responsibility**: Taking care of a dog teaches you important skills like feeding on schedule, cleaning up after them, and making sure they get exercise. These are life skills you'll use forever.

3. **Keep You Active**: Dogs need walks and playtime, which means you'll spend more time outside running, playing fetch, and exploring. This is great for your health and helps you make new friends at the park!

Dogs aren't just pets - they become part of your family and make every day more fun."
/>

**Now you try!** Improve this vague prompt:

<PromptEditor
  exerciseId="lab1-ex1"
  labNumber={1}
  placeholder="Write a better version of: 'Tell me about cats'

Hint: Be specific about:
- Who should the explanation be for?
- What aspects of cats interest you?
- How long should the answer be?"
/>

**Success Criteria**:
- Your prompt asks for specific information about cats
- It includes context (who it's for, what aspects, etc.)
- The AI response is focused and detailed

---

### ‚úèÔ∏è Exercise 2: Let AI Write a Story

Now let's have fun! Ask the AI to write a creative story.

**Try this**:

<PromptEditor
  exerciseId="lab1-ex2"
  labNumber={1}
  placeholder="Write a short adventure story about a brave cat. Include:
- Where the adventure takes place
- What challenge the cat faces
- How the cat solves the problem
Keep it under 150 words."
/>

**What to notice**:
- The more details you provide, the better the story
- Each time you run it, you'll get a slightly different story
- The AI follows your instructions (length, elements to include)

---

## üí° Key Discoveries

### What You Learned Today

1. **LLMs are prediction machines** - They generate text by predicting what words should come next, based on patterns from their training data.

2. **Clarity matters** - The more specific and clear your prompt, the better the AI's response will be.

3. **Variability is normal** - LLMs have some randomness, so running the same prompt twice gives slightly different results.

4. **AI is a tool** - LLMs are powerful assistants, but they're not thinking beings. They're tools that help us work faster and learn better.

## üéØ Quick Quiz

Before moving on, make sure you understand:

- [ ] What does LLM stand for? (Large Language Model)
- [ ] How is an LLM different from a search engine?
- [ ] What is a "prompt"?
- [ ] Why do you get slightly different answers each time you run the same prompt?

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

Great job! You've taken your first steps into the world of AI.

**In Lab 2**, you'll learn:
- How LLMs actually learn (where does all that knowledge come from?)
- Advanced techniques for writing clear, effective prompts
- Why being specific makes AI much more useful
