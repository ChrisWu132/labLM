# Lab 1: What is a Prompt

## 📖 Learning Objectives

- Understand what a prompt is
- Learn to write basic instructions
- Understand how LLMs interpret input

## 🎯 Core Concepts

**Prompt** is what you say to the AI.

Just like asking a friend a question, the AI responds based on what you tell it.

**Example:**

<StaticPromptDemo
  exerciseId="lab1-demo"
  initialValue="Tell me about cats"
  demoOutput="Cats are adorable domestic animals. They typically have soft fur, agile movements, enjoy sunbathing and playing. Cats have strong independence but also like to interact with their owners..."
/>

See that? We give the AI a simple instruction, and it provides an introduction about cats.

However, this response is a bit too broad. What if we want more specific information?

## ✏️ Hands-On Practice

### Exercise 1: Make the Response More Specific

**Task**: Modify the prompt below to get a more specific response from the AI, such as only introducing **cat behavior**.

<PromptEditor
  exerciseId="lab1-ex1"
  mode="editable"
  initialValue="Tell me about cats"
/>

**Goal**: The output should focus on cat behavior, not general information.

**Hints**:
- Try explicitly stating in your prompt that you want to know about "cat behavior"
- You could say "Please describe cat behavior" or "What behavioral characteristics do cats have"

### Exercise 2: Make the AI Tell a Story

**Task**: Write a prompt from scratch to make the AI write a short story about a cat's adventure.

<PromptEditor
  exerciseId="lab1-ex2"
  mode="blank"
  placeholder="Write your prompt here..."
/>

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Output includes content related to "story" and "adventure"
- ✅ At least 100 words

**Hint**: Try saying "Write a story about..."
