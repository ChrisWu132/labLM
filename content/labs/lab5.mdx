## Part A: AI Ethics & Responsible Use (12 minutes)

Now that you know HOW to use AI effectively, let's talk about WHEN and HOW you should use it responsibly.

### Academic Integrity: The Right Way to Use AI

Using AI for schoolwork is like using a calculator‚Äîit's a tool that can help you learn, but you need to use it correctly.

---

### ‚úÖ GOOD: AI-Assisted Learning

**These uses help you LEARN:**

**1. Understanding Concepts**
```
‚ùå BAD: "What's the answer to question 5 on my worksheet?"
‚úÖ GOOD: "I don't understand photosynthesis. Can you explain it using a simple analogy?"
```

**2. Getting Unstuck**
```
‚ùå BAD: "Write my essay about Romeo and Juliet."
‚úÖ GOOD: "I'm writing about themes in Romeo and Juliet. Can you help me brainstorm 3 possible themes to explore?"
```

**3. Checking Your Work**
```
‚ùå BAD: "Solve this math problem for me."
‚úÖ GOOD: "I solved this problem and got X. Can you check my steps and tell me if I made a mistake?"
```

**4. Learning New Skills**
```
‚ùå BAD: "Write my code for me."
‚úÖ GOOD: "I'm trying to create a loop in Python but I'm stuck. Can you explain how loops work with an example?"
```

---

### ‚ùå BAD: Plagiarism & Cheating

**These uses hurt your learning:**

**1. Direct Copying**
- Asking AI to write your essay and submitting it as yours
- Copying answers from AI without understanding
- Using AI to do your homework entirely

**2. Avoiding Learning**
- Never attempting problems yourself first
- Using AI as a shortcut instead of a learning tool
- Not understanding what the AI produces

**3. Academic Dishonesty**
- Submitting AI-generated work as your own original work
- Using AI during tests when it's not allowed
- Not citing AI when you're required to

---

### The Golden Rule of AI for School

**Use AI to help you LEARN, not to AVOID learning.**

**Ask yourself:**
- "Am I learning from this, or just getting an answer?"
- "Could I explain this to someone else after using AI?"
- "Am I using AI to understand better, or to skip the work?"

If you're not learning, you're using it wrong!

---

### Privacy & Safety: What NOT to Tell AI

**Rule**: Treat AI like a stranger on the internet‚Äîdon't share personal information!

---

### ‚ùå NEVER Share With AI:

**1. Personal Information**
- Your full name, address, phone number
- Your school's name or exact location
- Your age, birthday, or identifying details

**2. Passwords & Security**
- Any passwords
- Security questions/answers
- Banking or financial information

**3. Private Content**
- Family photos or personal photos
- Private conversations
- Confidential information about others

**4. Plans & Location**
- Where you'll be and when
- Your daily schedule
- Travel plans

---

### ‚úÖ Safe to Share:

**General information that doesn't identify you:**
- "I'm a middle school student learning about..."
- "I'm working on a science project about..."
- "I'm interested in learning programming..."

---

### üéØ Interactive Exercise: Ethics Quiz

Let's test your judgment! For each scenario, decide if it's ethical AI use:

<PromptEditor
  exerciseId="lab5-ethics"
  mode="editable"
  placeholder="Analyze these scenarios. Which ones are ethical?

Scenario 1: Sarah is stuck on a math problem. She asks AI to explain the concept, then solves the problem herself.

Scenario 2: Tom asks AI to write his entire history essay, then copies it word-for-word and submits it.

Scenario 3: Maya uses AI to brainstorm ideas for her science fair project, then researches and develops her favorite idea on her own.

Scenario 4: Alex is taking a test and secretly uses AI on his phone to answer questions.

Which scenarios show responsible AI use? Explain why or why not."
/>

**Think about:**
- Is the student learning?
- Is it honest?
- Would a teacher approve?

---

### Creating Your Personal AI Usage Principles

Let's create YOUR rules for using AI responsibly!

**My AI Usage Principles:**

1. **Learning First**: I will use AI to help me understand, not to avoid thinking
2. **Honesty**: I will be honest about when I use AI and never claim AI's work as my own
3. **Privacy**: I will never share personal information with AI
4. **Critical Thinking**: I will always verify important facts and not blindly trust AI
5. **Effort**: I will try problems myself first before asking AI for help

**Add your own:**
<PromptEditor
  exerciseId="lab5-principles"
  mode="editable"
  placeholder="Write your personal AI usage principles. What rules will you follow?

Example:
- I will use AI to learn, not to cheat
- I will always try problems myself first
