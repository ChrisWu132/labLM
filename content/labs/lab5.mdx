# Lab 5: Comprehensive Application Challenge

## üìñ Learning Objectives

- Combine all prompt engineering techniques
- Solve complex, multi-step real-world problems
- Master the art of crafting powerful prompts
- Build confidence in communicating with AI

---

## üéØ What You've Learned So Far

Let's recap the powerful techniques from Labs 1-4:

| Lab | Technique | When to Use |
|-----|-----------|-------------|
| **Lab 1** | Clear Instructions | Always - foundation of good prompts |
| **Lab 2** | Specificity & Context | When you need precise, detailed outputs |
| **Lab 3** | Role Assignment | When you want specific expertise or perspective |
| **Lab 4** | Chain-of-Thought | For complex reasoning, math, planning, debugging |

**Now it's time to combine them all!**

---

## üöÄ The Power of Combined Techniques

The best prompts use multiple techniques together. Here's how they stack:

### Example: Weak vs Strong Prompt

**‚ùå Weak Prompt:**
```
Write a marketing email for my app.
```

**‚úÖ Strong Prompt (combining all techniques):**
```
You are an experienced SaaS marketing copywriter with expertise in B2B email campaigns.

Write a cold outreach email for "TaskMaster Pro" - a project management tool that helps small teams (5-20 people) reduce meeting time by 40%.

Requirements:
- Target audience: Startup founders and small business owners
- Tone: Professional but friendly, not salesy
- Length: 150-200 words
- Include: One specific pain point, one clear benefit, one call-to-action
- Format: Subject line + body

Think step-by-step:
1. What's the biggest pain point for this audience?
2. How does our product solve it uniquely?
3. What's the most compelling call-to-action?

Show your reasoning before writing the email.
```

See the difference? The strong prompt combines:
- üé≠ **Role** (SaaS marketing copywriter)
- üìã **Specific requirements** (audience, tone, length, structure)
- üîó **Context** (product details, target audience)
- üß† **Chain-of-Thought** (step-by-step reasoning)

## üìö Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Code Review Assistant

<StaticPromptDemo
  prompt="You are a senior software engineer conducting a code review.

Review this React component and provide actionable feedback:

```jsx
function UserProfile({ user }) {
  const [data, setData] = useState()

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('/api/user/' + user.id)
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(setData)
  })

  return <div>{data.name}</div>
}
```

Please analyze:
1. Potential bugs or errors
2. Performance issues
3. Best practice violations
4. Security concerns

For each issue, explain:
- What's wrong
- Why it's a problem
- How to fix it

Think through this systematically."
  output="Let me review this code step by step:

**1. CRITICAL BUG - Missing useEffect dependency array**
- **What's wrong:** useEffect runs on every render
- **Why it's a problem:** Creates infinite loop (fetch ‚Üí setState ‚Üí re-render ‚Üí fetch...)
- **Fix:** Add dependency array: `useEffect(() => {...}, [user.id])`

**2. ERROR - Unsafe data access**
- **What's wrong:** `data.name` called when data is undefined initially
- **Why it's a problem:** Will crash: 'Cannot read property name of undefined'
- **Fix:** Add conditional: `{data?.name}` or loading state

**3. PERFORMANCE - Missing error handling**
- **What's wrong:** No .catch() on fetch promise
- **Why it's a problem:** Silent failures, poor UX
- **Fix:** Add error handling and display error state

**4. SECURITY - String concatenation in URL**
- **What's wrong:** Direct user.id concatenation
- **Why it's a problem:** Potential injection if ID contains special characters
- **Fix:** Use template literals and URL encoding

**Corrected version:**
```jsx
function UserProfile({ user }) {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null)
  const [error, setError] = useState(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch(`/api/user/${encodeURIComponent(user.id)}`)
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(setData)
      .catch(setError)
  }, [user.id])

  if (error) return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>
  if (!data) return <div>Loading...</div>
  return <div>{data.name}</div>
}
```"
/>

### Scenario 2: Data Analysis & Insights

<StaticPromptDemo
  prompt="You are a data analyst helping a startup understand their user metrics.

Analyze this data and provide insights:

**Week 1-4 Metrics:**
- Week 1: 100 signups, 45 active users (45%), 5 paying (5%)
- Week 2: 150 signups, 60 active users (40%), 8 paying (5.3%)
- Week 3: 200 signups, 70 active users (35%), 12 paying (6%)
- Week 4: 250 signups, 75 active users (30%), 15 paying (6%)

Questions:
1. What trends do you see?
2. What's concerning?
3. What should we investigate?
4. What actions would you recommend?

Please think through each metric systematically and explain your reasoning."
  output="Let me analyze these metrics step by step:

## 1. Trends Identified

**Positive:**
- ‚úÖ Signups growing 50% weekly (strong)
- ‚úÖ Paying conversion improving (5% ‚Üí 6%)
- ‚úÖ Absolute active users increasing (45 ‚Üí 75)

**Negative:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL:** Activation rate dropping (45% ‚Üí 30%)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Active user growth not keeping pace with signups

## 2. Concerning Patterns

**Activation Problem:**
Week 1: 55 of 100 never activated (55% churn)
Week 4: 175 of 250 never activated (70% churn)

This is your biggest issue - onboarding is failing at scale.

## 3. What to Investigate

**Priority 1 - Onboarding breakdown:**
- Where do new users drop off?
- Did you change onboarding recently?
- Are new users getting proper guidance?

**Priority 2 - Product quality:**
- Is the product breaking under load?
- Are new features confusing users?

**Priority 3 - Traffic sources:**
- Are new signups lower quality?
- Different acquisition channels?

## 4. Recommended Actions

**Immediate (This Week):**
1. Add analytics to onboarding flow - find the drop-off point
2. Interview 10 users who signed up but never activated
3. A/B test simplified onboarding

**Short-term (2-4 weeks):**
1. Improve first-run experience
2. Add progress indicators
3. Send activation reminder emails

**Measurement:**
Target: Get activation back to 40%+ within 4 weeks
Track: Daily activation rates, onboarding completion steps

**Bottom line:** You're growing signups but losing users before they experience value. Fix activation before scaling further."

## üí° Advanced Tips & Tricks

### 1. Iterative Refinement
Don't expect perfection on the first try. Use this process:
```
First prompt ‚Üí Review output ‚Üí Refine prompt ‚Üí Better output
```

### 2. The "Few-Shot" Technique
Show examples of what you want:
```
Write product descriptions in this style:

Example 1: "Cloud Backup Pro - Never lose a file again.
Automatic backups every hour, restored in seconds. $5/month."

Example 2: "TaskMaster - Your team's second brain.
Track projects, assign tasks, hit deadlines. Free for 5 users."

Now write one for: [your product]
```

### 3. Constraints Drive Creativity
Tight constraints often produce better results:
- "Explain quantum computing in 3 sentences for a 10-year-old"
- "Write a product pitch in exactly 50 words"
- "Create a logo concept using only circles and triangles"

### 4. Output Format Specification
Tell the AI exactly how to format the response:
```
Provide your answer as:
1. Executive Summary (2 sentences)
2. Detailed Analysis (bullet points)
3. Recommendations (numbered list)
4. Next Steps (action items)
```
