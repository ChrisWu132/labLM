**1. Writing & Creative Content**
- Essays, stories, poems
- Product descriptions
- Email drafts
- Blog posts

**2. Explanation & Teaching**
- Breaking down complex concepts
- Using analogies
- Adapting to different audiences
- Answering "how" and "why" questions

**3. Summarization**
- Condensing long texts
- Extracting key points
- Creating executive summaries

**4. Translation & Language**
- Translating between languages
- Rephrasing for different tones
- Grammar and style improvements

**5. Brainstorming**
- Generating ideas
- Exploring possibilities
- Creative problem-solving

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Use AI Carefully For...

These tasks work **sometimes**, but verify the results:

**1. Math & Calculations**
- Simple math usually works
- Complex calculations can have errors
- Multi-step math problems are risky

**2. Current Events & Facts**
- Knowledge cutoff means outdated info
- Can't access real-time data
- Dates and recent events may be wrong

**3. Specific Facts & Statistics**
- May confuse similar facts
- Numbers might be approximations
- Always verify important data

---

### ‚ùå AI's Weaknesses

LLMs genuinely **struggle** with:

**1. Complex Reasoning**
- Deep logical chains
- Multi-step problem solving (without guidance)
- Abstract mathematical proofs

**2. Real-Time Information**
- Can't browse the internet (most models)
- No access to current news
- Doesn't know what happened after training

**3. Personal Knowledge**
- Doesn't know you or your life
- Can't remember previous conversations (in different sessions)
- No access to private information

**4. Hallucinations** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Sometimes invents plausible-sounding but false information
- Fills gaps in knowledge with "reasonable guesses"
- Can state incorrect things confidently

### üî¨ Interactive Experiment 1: Testing Math Skills

Let's see where AI shines and where it stumbles!

**Try these math problems and observe:**

<PromptEditor
  exerciseId="lab4-demo1"
  labNumber={4}
  placeholder="Try these and see which ones work well:

1. What is 47 + 89?
2. What is 15% of $240?
3. If I buy 3 items at $12.47 each, with 8% sales tax, what's the total?

Notice: Simple math works great, but complex multi-step calculations may have errors!"
/>

**What did you discover?**
- ‚úÖ Basic arithmetic ‚Üí Usually correct
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Percentages & simple calculations ‚Üí Mostly correct
- ‚ùå Multi-step calculations ‚Üí May have mistakes

**Key lesson**: For important math, always verify or use a calculator!

---

### üî¨ Interactive Experiment 2: Fact-Checking Challenge

Let's test AI's knowledge accuracy:

<PromptEditor
  exerciseId="lab4-demo2"
  labNumber={4}
  placeholder="Ask the AI:

1. Who won the FIFA World Cup in 2018?
2. What is the current population of Tokyo?
3. What major AI breakthroughs happened in 2024?

Compare answers to what you can verify online. Are they accurate?"
/>

**What to watch for:**
- Historical facts (2018 World Cup) ‚Üí Likely accurate
- Current statistics (population) ‚Üí Might be outdated
- Recent events (2024) ‚Üí May be past the knowledge cutoff

---

### Understanding "Hallucinations" ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Hallucination** = When AI makes up information that sounds plausible but is **completely false**

**Why does this happen?**

Remember: AI is a pattern predictor. When it doesn't know something, it sometimes:
1. Recognizes the pattern of how answers should sound
2. Generates a "reasonable-sounding" response
3. States it confidently (even though it's wrong!)

**Example of a hallucination:**

**Bad Prompt:**
<StaticPromptDemo
  prompt="Tell me about the book 'The Adventures of Captain Whiskers' by Jane Smith."
  output="'The Adventures of Captain Whiskers' by Jane Smith is a beloved children's novel published in 2015. It follows the journey of Captain Whiskers, a brave ship captain, as he explores magical islands. The book won the Children's Literature Award in 2016 and has been translated into 15 languages."
/>

**The problem**: This book **doesn't exist!** The AI invented all those details because they "sound right" for a children's book.

---

### üî¨ Interactive Experiment 3: Catching Hallucinations

Try to make the AI hallucinate by asking about something fake:

<PromptEditor
  exerciseId="lab4-demo3"
  labNumber={4}
  placeholder="Ask about a completely made-up topic:

'Tell me about the scientific theory of Quantum Biscuits discovered by Dr. Martin Crumbsworth in 1987.'

See if the AI catches that this is fake, or if it plays along!"
/>

**What happened?**
- If the AI is cautious ‚Üí Good! It might say "I don't have information about this"
- If the AI generates details ‚Üí Hallucination! It's making things up

**Key lesson**: Don't blindly trust AI. Verify important information!

---

### How to Avoid Hallucinations

**1. Ask for sources** (though AI can't provide real links)
```
"Explain photosynthesis and note if you're uncertain about any details."
```

**2. Break down complex questions**
```
Instead of: "Tell me everything about quantum computing"
Try: "What is quantum computing?" then "How does a qubit work?"
```

**3. Cross-reference important facts**
- Use search engines for verification
- Check multiple sources
- Don't rely on AI alone for critical decisions

**4. Watch for confidence without evidence**
- Be skeptical of very specific numbers/dates
- Question claims that seem too perfect
- Verify anything that matters

---

## Part B: Chain-of-Thought Reasoning (15 minutes)

Now that you know AI's limitations, let's learn to **compensate** for them with a powerful technique!

### What is Chain-of-Thought (CoT)?

**Chain-of-Thought** = Asking the AI to show its reasoning step-by-step before giving an answer

**Why this helps:**
- Reduces errors in complex problems
- Makes reasoning visible (so you can check it)
- Forces the AI to "think" more carefully
- Catches mistakes early

---

### The Magic Phrase

**"Let's think step by step"**

That's it! This simple phrase dramatically improves AI reasoning.

**Example:**

**Without CoT:**
<StaticPromptDemo
  prompt="If a train leaves Chicago at 2 PM traveling at 60 mph, and another train leaves St. Louis at 3 PM traveling at 75 mph, and they're 300 miles apart, when do they meet?"
  output="They will meet at approximately 5:24 PM."
/>

**With CoT:**
<StaticPromptDemo
  prompt="If a train leaves Chicago at 2 PM traveling at 60 mph, and another train leaves St. Louis at 3 PM traveling at 75 mph, and they're 300 miles apart, when do they meet?

Let's think step by step."
  output="Let me solve this step by step:

**Step 1**: Determine the first train's head start
- Train 1 leaves at 2 PM
- Train 2 leaves at 3 PM
- Head start: 1 hour

**Step 2**: Calculate distance covered by Train 1 in the head start
- Speed: 60 mph √ó 1 hour = 60 miles
- Remaining distance: 300 - 60 = 240 miles

**Step 3**: Calculate combined approach speed
- Train 1: 60 mph
- Train 2: 75 mph
- Combined: 60 + 75 = 135 mph (approaching each other)

**Step 4**: Calculate time to meet
- Distance: 240 miles
- Speed: 135 mph
- Time: 240 √∑ 135 = 1.78 hours ‚âà 1 hour 47 minutes

**Step 5**: Add to Train 2's departure time
- Train 2 leaves: 3:00 PM
- Plus: 1 hour 47 minutes
- Meet time: **4:47 PM**"
/>

**See the difference?** You can follow the logic and verify each step!

### ‚úèÔ∏è Exercise 1: Using "Let's Think Step by Step"

Try Chain-of-Thought on a problem:

<PromptEditor
  exerciseId="lab4-ex1"
  labNumber={4}
  placeholder="I have a rectangular garden that's 12 feet long and 8 feet wide. I want to put a fence around it, and fencing costs $15 per foot. How much will the fence cost?

Let's think step by step."
/>

**Success Criteria:**
- AI breaks down the problem into steps
- Shows calculation for perimeter
- Shows calculation for total cost
- Gives a clear final answer

---

### ‚úèÔ∏è Exercise 2: Structured Reasoning Template

You can guide the AI's thinking with a template:

<PromptEditor
  exerciseId="lab4-ex2"
  labNumber={4}
  placeholder="I need to decide: Should I learn Python or JavaScript first for web development?

Please analyze this by:
1. Listing the key factors to consider
2. Comparing Python vs JavaScript on each factor
3. Providing a recommendation with clear reasoning"
/>

**What to notice:**
- The structure ensures thorough analysis
- Each factor gets considered
- The reasoning is transparent

---

### ‚úèÔ∏è Exercise 3: Debugging with CoT

Chain-of-Thought is excellent for finding errors:

<PromptEditor
  exerciseId="lab4-ex3"
  labNumber={4}
  placeholder="This code should count from 1 to 10, but it's not working correctly:

```python
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
```

Walk me through what this code does step-by-step, and explain why it's not giving the expected output."
/>

**Expected output:**
- Step-by-step trace of the code
- Explanation of what `range(10)` does
- Identification of the problem (starts at 0, not 1)
- Solution suggestion
