## ðŸŽ¯ What is Chain-of-Thought?

**Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** is a prompting technique where you ask the AI to break down its reasoning into steps, showing its "thought process" before arriving at a conclusion.

### Why Use Chain-of-Thought?

1. **More Accurate Results**: Step-by-step reasoning reduces errors
2. **Verifiable Logic**: You can see where the AI might go wrong
3. **Better for Complex Tasks**: Math, analysis, planning, debugging
4. **Transparency**: Understand how the AI arrived at its answer

## ðŸ“š Core Concepts

### 1. Basic CoT Trigger Phrases

Simple phrases that activate step-by-step thinking:

- "Let's think step by step"
- "Show your work"
- "Explain your reasoning"
- "Walk me through the process"

**Example:**

<StaticPromptDemo
  prompt="Calculate the total cost: 3 books at $12.50 each, with 15% discount and 8% tax. Let's think step by step."
  output="Let me break this down:

Step 1: Calculate subtotal
3 books Ã— $12.50 = $37.50

Step 2: Apply 15% discount
15% of $37.50 = $5.625
$37.50 - $5.625 = $31.875

Step 3: Calculate 8% tax on discounted price
8% of $31.875 = $2.55
$31.875 + $2.55 = $34.425

**Final total: $34.43** (rounded to nearest cent)"

### 2. Structured Reasoning Templates

Guide the AI to follow a specific reasoning structure:

**Problem-Solving Template:**
```
1. Understand the problem
2. Identify key information
3. Plan the approach
4. Execute step-by-step
5. Verify the result
```

**Example:**

<StaticPromptDemo
  prompt="I need to fit 47 students into vans that hold 8 people each. How many vans do I need?

Please solve this by:
1. Identifying the key numbers
2. Determining the math operation
3. Calculating the result
4. Interpreting what the answer means"
  output="Let me solve this systematically:

**1. Key Information:**
- Total students: 47
- Van capacity: 8 students per van

**2. Math Operation:**
We need division: 47 Ã· 8

**3. Calculation:**
47 Ã· 8 = 5.875

**4. Interpretation:**
5.875 vans means we need 5 full vans plus a 6th van for the remaining students.
- 5 vans Ã— 8 = 40 students
- Remaining: 47 - 40 = 7 students

**Answer: You need 6 vans** (5 full + 1 with 7 students)"
/>

### 3. Debugging with CoT

Use CoT to debug code or troubleshoot problems:

<StaticPromptDemo
  prompt="This Python code isn't working:

```python
total = 0
for i in range(5):
    total += i
print(total)
```

I expected the result to be 15, but I'm getting 10. Walk me through what's happening step by step."
  output="Let me trace through this step-by-step:

**Loop iteration breakdown:**

i = 0: total = 0 + 0 = 0
i = 1: total = 0 + 1 = 1
i = 2: total = 1 + 2 = 3
i = 3: total = 3 + 3 = 6
i = 4: total = 6 + 4 = 10

**Final result: 10**

**Why it's 10, not 15:**
- range(5) generates: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 (starts at 0!)
- Sum: 0+1+2+3+4 = 10
- You expected: 1+2+3+4+5 = 15

**Solution:** Use `range(1, 6)` to get 1 through 5, or use `range(6)` and sum will be 15 (0+1+2+3+4+5)."

### 4. Decision-Making with CoT

Help AI make better decisions by showing pros/cons analysis:

<StaticPromptDemo
  prompt="Should I learn React or Vue.js as my first frontend framework?

Please analyze this decision by:
1. Listing key factors to consider
2. Comparing React vs Vue on each factor
3. Providing a recommendation with reasoning"
  output="Let me analyze this systematically:

**1. Key Factors:**
- Learning curve
- Job market demand
- Community & ecosystem
- Documentation quality
- Project requirements

**2. Comparison:**

| Factor | React | Vue.js |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Learning Curve | Steeper (JSX, hooks) | Gentler (HTML-like templates) |
| Job Market | Higher demand | Growing but smaller |
| Community | Massive (Facebook-backed) | Strong & supportive |
| Documentation | Good but scattered | Excellent & comprehensive |
| Use Cases | Large-scale apps | Rapid prototyping, startups |

**3. Recommendation:**

**Choose React if:**
- You want maximum job opportunities
- You're willing to invest more upfront learning time
- You plan to work on large-scale applications

**Choose Vue if:**
- You want to build projects quickly while learning
- You prefer clearer, more intuitive syntax
- You're working on smaller to medium projects

**For a first framework, I recommend React** - the steeper learning curve pays off with better job prospects and transferable skills to other modern frameworks."

## ðŸŽ¯ Practice Exercise

Now it's your turn! Try using Chain-of-Thought to solve this problem:

**Challenge:** Write a prompt that asks the AI to plan a 3-day trip to Tokyo for two people with a $2000 budget. Make the AI show its reasoning for:
- How it allocates the budget
- Why it chose specific activities
- How it balanced cost and experience

**Success Criteria:**
- Ask the AI to break down the budget allocation step-by-step
- Request reasoning for each major decision
- Include at least 3 cost categories (flights, hotels, food, activities, etc.)

<PromptEditor
  exerciseId="lab4-ex1"
  labNumber={4}
  placeholder="Write your prompt here...

Hint: Start with 'Let's plan this trip step by step' or ask the AI to 'show your budget reasoning'"

## ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways

1. **"Let's think step by step"** is your magic phrase for better reasoning
2. **CoT is essential for**: Math, logic, debugging, planning, analysis
3. **Structure helps**: Give the AI a template to follow
4. **Verification**: Step-by-step output lets you catch errors early
5. **Complex > Simple**: Use CoT when the task has multiple steps
