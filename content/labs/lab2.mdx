# Lab 2: How to Give Clear Instructions

## üìñ Learning Objectives

- Understand the importance of clear expression
- Learn to avoid vague prompts
- Master the technique of adding constraints

## üéØ Core Concepts

**Clear > Vague**

AI can't read minds. If your prompt is vague, the AI can only guess what you want.

### Comparison Examples

#### ‚ùå Vague Prompt

<StaticPromptDemo
  exerciseId="lab2-demo-bad"
  initialValue="Write something"
  demoOutput="Here is some text. I'm not quite sure what you want, so I wrote some generic content..."
/>

---

#### ‚úÖ Clear Prompt

<StaticPromptDemo
  exerciseId="lab2-demo-good"
  initialValue="Write a paragraph of about 50 words explaining why exercise is good for health. Use simple, easy-to-understand language."
  demoOutput="Exercise makes your body stronger and your heart healthier. People who exercise regularly get sick less often and have better mental health. Exercising 30 minutes daily, such as running, swimming or playing sports, can make you healthier and happier."
/>

See the difference? A clear prompt includes:
- ‚úÖ A specific task ("explain why...")
- ‚úÖ Specific requirements ("about 50 words")
- ‚úÖ Style guidance ("simple, easy-to-understand")

## ‚úèÔ∏è Hands-On Practice

### Exercise 1: Improve a Vague Prompt

The prompt below is too vague. Modify it to get a more useful response from the AI.

<PromptEditor
  exerciseId="lab2-ex1"
  mode="editable"
  initialValue="Introduce programming"
/>

**Hints**:
- What angle do you want? (For beginners? Or in-depth technical?)
- How long should the response be?
- What tone do you want? (Formal? Casual?)

---

### Exercise 2: Add Constraints

Have the AI list the benefits of healthy eating in three bullet points.

<PromptEditor
  exerciseId="lab2-ex2"
  mode="editable"
  initialValue="Talk about the benefits of healthy eating"
/>

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ Output contains 3 bullet points
- ‚úÖ Clear formatting (using list or numbering)

**Hint**: Explicitly state "in three bullet points" or "list three" in your prompt

### üéì Challenge: Get JSON Format Output

This is an advanced exercise! Write a prompt to make the AI return book information in JSON format.

**Requirements:**
- Book title: "Journey to the West"
- Fields: title, author, year, genre

<PromptEditor
  exerciseId="lab2-ex3"
  mode="blank"
  placeholder="Write a prompt to get AI to return JSON format..."
/>

**Hint**: Try saying "in JSON format" or "return a JSON object with the following fields..."

## üìù Summary

You learned:

- ‚úÖ Specific and clear > vague and general
- ‚úÖ Add constraints (length, format, style)
- ‚úÖ Clear prompts = useful outputs

**üí° Pro Tip**:

Including the following elements in your prompt can get better results:
1. **Task** - What you want the AI to do
2. **Constraints** - Length, format, style
3. **Context** - Background information (if needed)
4. **Examples** - Expected output style (optional)
