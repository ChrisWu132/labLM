# Lab 3: AI's "Thinking" Process

## üìñ Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will:
- Understand how LLMs generate responses word-by-word
- Learn what "tokens" are and how AI processes text
- Discover why the same prompt gives slightly different answers
- Master role-playing techniques to control output style
- Create custom AI assistant personas

**Duration**: ~25 minutes

## Part A: How LLMs Generate Responses (12 minutes)

### The Word-by-Word Generation Process

Remember: LLMs are "next word predictors." Let's see how they actually generate responses!

**Imagine you ask**: "What is the capital of France?"

**Here's what happens inside the AI**:

```
Your question: "What is the capital of France?"

AI thinks step-by-step:
1. "The" (most likely start)
2. "The capital" (logical continuation)
3. "The capital of" (completing the pattern)
4. "The capital of France" (repeating your question)
5. "The capital of France is" (setting up the answer)
6. "The capital of France is Paris" (THE answer!)
7. "The capital of France is Paris." (add punctuation, DONE!)
```

**Key insight**: The AI doesn't "know" the full answer upfront. It generates it **one piece at a time**, with each word influencing what comes next!

---

### What Are Tokens?

**Token** = The basic unit of text that AI processes

Think of tokens as puzzle pieces that make up words and sentences.

**Examples:**
- "cat" = 1 token
- "running" = 1 token (sometimes 2: "run" + "ning")
- "The cat sat on the mat" = 7 tokens
- "don't" = 2 tokens ("don" + "'t")

**Why tokens matter:**
- AI processes text in tokens, not letters
- Longer prompts = more tokens = higher cost
- Token limits exist (e.g., 4000 tokens max)

---

### üî¨ Interactive Experiment 1: Observing Variations

Let's see the AI generate responses! Run this same prompt **3 times** and compare:

<PromptEditor
  exerciseId="lab3-demo1"
  mode="editable"
  placeholder="Write a creative opening sentence for a mystery story about a missing cat.

Run this 3 times and notice how each opening is different!"
/>

**What did you observe?**
- ‚úÖ Each response is slightly different
- ‚úÖ All responses are relevant to the prompt
- ‚úÖ The AI makes different "creative choices" each time

**Why does this happen?**

At each step, the AI has multiple good options:
- "The cat disappeared..." (40% likely)
- "On a foggy evening..." (30% likely)
- "Nobody knew when..." (20% likely)
- "Detective Smith noticed..." (10% likely)

The AI **randomly picks** from the top options, so you get variety!

---

### The Role of Context

**Context** = Everything that came before the current word

Context is SUPER important because it shapes what the AI predicts next.

**Example:**

| Context | Next word likely... |
|---------|-------------------|
| "The doctor said I need..." | medicine, rest, surgery |
| "The baker said I need..." | flour, eggs, more oven space |
| "The teacher said I need..." | to study, more practice, to pay attention |

Same structure, but **context changes everything!**

---

### üî¨ Interactive Experiment 2: Adding Context

Let's see how adding context improves responses:

**First, try with NO context:**
<PromptEditor
  exerciseId="lab3-demo2a"
  mode="editable"
  placeholder="Explain quantum mechanics."
/>

**Now, try with RICH context:**
<PromptEditor
  exerciseId="lab3-demo2b"
  mode="editable"
  placeholder="I'm a 13-year-old who loves video games. Explain quantum mechanics using a video game analogy that makes it exciting and easy to understand."
/>

**What changed?**
- With context: The AI knows WHO you are, WHAT you like, and HOW to explain
- Without context: The AI gives a generic, possibly boring explanation

**This is why context matters!** It shapes every word the AI chooses.

---

### Why Responses Vary (Probabilistic Selection)

At each step, the AI has choices:

**Example: Completing "The cat was..."**

| Option | Probability | Will AI pick it? |
|--------|------------|-----------------|
| "sleeping" | 35% | Often |
| "hiding" | 25% | Sometimes |
| "hungry" | 20% | Sometimes |
| "orange" | 15% | Rarely |
| "dancing" | 5% | Very rarely |

The AI uses **probabilistic selection** - it doesn't always pick the most likely option, but mixes in some variety!

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Creative responses (not always the same)
- ‚úÖ Natural-sounding language
- ‚úÖ Interesting variations

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Slightly different each time
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Occasionally unexpected choices

---

## Part B: Role-Playing Magic (13 minutes)

Now that you understand how AI generates text, let's learn to **control** its style using roles!

### Why Role-Setting Works

Remember: Context shapes every word the AI chooses.

**When you set a role** (like "You are a teacher"), you're providing powerful context that influences:
- Vocabulary choice
- Explanation style
- Level of detail
- Tone and personality

---

### The Magic Phrase: "You are..."

The simplest way to set a role:

**"You are a [ROLE]. [Your request]."**

**Examples:**
- "You are a patient teacher. Explain photosynthesis to a 10-year-old."
- "You are a creative poet. Write a poem about the ocean."
- "You are a professional chef. Give me a recipe for chocolate cake."

This tiny phrase completely changes the AI's "personality"!

---

### ‚úèÔ∏è Exercise 1: AI as a Teacher

Let's make the AI explain a complex topic as if it's a patient, encouraging teacher:

<PromptEditor
  exerciseId="lab3-ex1"
  mode="editable"
  placeholder="You are a friendly and patient middle school science teacher who loves using analogies.

Explain how the internet works to a student who has never thought about it before. Use a simple analogy and keep it under 100 words."
/>

**What to notice:**
- The AI adopts a teaching tone
- Uses analogies (because you asked!)
- Explains at an appropriate level
- Sounds encouraging and friendly

---

### ‚úèÔ∏è Exercise 2: AI as a Creative Writer

Now let's give the AI a creative persona:

<PromptEditor
  exerciseId="lab3-ex2"
  mode="editable"
  placeholder="You are a romantic poet who loves nature and uses vivid imagery.

Write a 4-line poem about autumn leaves falling from trees."
/>

**Compare this to a non-role version:**
<StaticPromptDemo
  initialValue="Write a 4-line poem about autumn leaves."
  demoOutput="Leaves are falling down,
From the trees so high,
Orange, red, and brown,
Dancing in the sky."
/>

**The poet version will be more:**
- Vivid and descriptive
- Emotional and romantic
- Rich in imagery

---

### ‚úèÔ∏è Exercise 3: Comparing Different Roles

Let's see how the SAME task changes with different roles!

**Task**: Explain why exercise is important

**Try these three different roles:**

**Role 1 - Doctor:**
<PromptEditor
  exerciseId="lab3-ex3a"
  mode="editable"
  placeholder="You are a medical doctor. Explain in 3 sentences why exercise is important for health."
/>

**Role 2 - Sports Coach:**
<PromptEditor
  exerciseId="lab3-ex3b"
  mode="editable"
  placeholder="You are an energetic sports coach. Explain in 3 sentences why exercise is important, using motivational language."
/>

**Role 3 - Scientist:**
<PromptEditor
  exerciseId="lab3-ex3c"
  mode="editable"
  placeholder="You are a research scientist. Explain in 3 sentences why exercise is important, focusing on biological mechanisms."
/>

**What differences do you see?**
- Doctor ‚Üí Medical/health focus
- Coach ‚Üí Motivational/performance focus
- Scientist ‚Üí Technical/biological focus

**Same topic, completely different approaches!**

---

### Advanced Role-Setting

You can combine multiple attributes:

**Super-specific role example:**
```
You are a patient, enthusiastic high school computer science teacher
with 15 years of experience who loves using real-world examples
and always encourages students to experiment and make mistakes.

Explain what a variable is in programming.
```

**The more specific, the more tailored the response!**

---

### üéì Challenge: Design Your Custom AI Assistant

Create your own AI assistant with a unique personality!

**Your task:** Design an AI assistant that helps with homework. Give it:
- A specific expertise (math, writing, science, etc.)
- A personality (patient, funny, strict, creative, etc.)
- A teaching style (uses analogies, step-by-step, questions, etc.)
- Any unique traits that make it special

**Then test it** with a sample homework question:

<PromptEditor
  exerciseId="lab3-challenge"
  mode="editable"
  placeholder="You are [describe your custom AI assistant's role and personality here]

[Then ask it a homework-related question to see how it responds]

Example:
You are Professor Sparks, an enthusiastic physics teacher who explains everything using superhero movie analogies and always adds fun facts. You encourage students to ask 'what if' questions.

Explain Newton's First Law of Motion."
/>

**Success Criteria:**
- Clear role definition
- Specific personality traits
- Unique teaching or communication style
- The response matches the personality you created

## üí° Key Discoveries

### What You Learned Today

1. **Word-by-Word Generation** - LLMs build responses one piece at a time, with each word influencing what comes next.

2. **Tokens** - The basic units that AI processes (roughly equivalent to words or word pieces).

3. **Context is King** - Everything that came before shapes what the AI predicts next. More context = better responses.

4. **Probabilistic Selection** - The AI doesn't always pick the most likely word, adding creativity and variation.

5. **Role-Playing Power** - Using "You are a [ROLE]" dramatically changes the AI's output style, tone, and approach.
